// There are three types of springs to control head movement:
//
// Sliding = spring/damper force maintains given direction relative to vehicle
// Normal = spring/damper force in direction between connection points
// FreeDamping = spring is normal, but damper resist velocity in any direction
//
// Parameters for springs are:
//
// SpringDir = direction of spring/damper forces (automatically normalized, not valid for Normal springs)
// SpringHead = connection to driver head (relative to head center)
// SpringBody = connection to vehicle body (relative to head center)
// SpringCollLen = if more than zero, spring doesn't take effect until minimum length has been reached
// SpringParams = spring rate and damper rate
